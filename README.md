# Linear Impact of Increased Hourly Wage on Production Rates for Equal Total Cost

# Project objective / description:

Reminder to field installers and upper management of linear relationship between hourly wage and production rates. Hourly rates can increase throughout a project for multiple reasons including: estimator used incorrect hourly rates, crew mix is skewed, and or overtime. Therefore, in order to have unchanging total cost as hourly rates increase from budget, production rates in turn shall increase. 

In below example, budgeted hourly rate was $116.45 per hour, production rate was 20 linear feet (LF) of wall per day, total wall to frame was 100 LF, and time to complete task was one day (eight hours). With these constraints I needed a five person crew for a total cost of $4,658.00. Although, similar to most tasks in construction, plans changed when time came to perform this work and my crew mix was 10% higher than budget due to a temporary increase in higher wage employees. I let the field know about the increased crew mix hourly wage ($128.10) and gave them the newly corresponding production rate (22 LF of wall per day) required to prevent an increase in total cost. In addition, another consequence requiring planning is change in crew size with an increased production rate. Original crew size for this task was five people but new crew size is 4.55 people. Additional, profitable work, will need to be scheduled for a partial day for one crew member.

This relationship is important to keep in mind and should be closely monitored. For example, when a client asks you to work overtime, without offering to cover premium time, inquiry should be focused on budget, actual, and forecast costs and corresponding labor components.

# Example scenarios:

One example where production rates were adjusted with hourly rate and another example where production rates did not adjust with hourly rate.
