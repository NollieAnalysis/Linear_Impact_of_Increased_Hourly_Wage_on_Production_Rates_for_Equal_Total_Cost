# linear_impact_of_increased_hourly_wage_on_production_rates_for_equal_total_cost

# Project objective:

Reminder to field installers and upper management of linear relationship between hourly wage and production rates. For example, in order to have unchanging total cost as hourly rates increase from budget, production rates in turn shall increase. 

Hourly rates can increase throughout a project for multiple reasons including: estimator used incorrect hourly rates, crew mix is skewed, and or overtime. In below example, budgeted hourly rate was $116.45 per hour, production rate was 20 linear feet (LF) of wall per day, total wall to frame was 100 LF, and time to complete task was one day (eight hours). With these constraints I needed a five person crew for a total cost of $4,658.00. Although, similar to most tasks in construction, plans changed when time came to perform this work and my crew mix was 10% higher than budget due to a temporary increase in higher wage employees.
